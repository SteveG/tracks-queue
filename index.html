<h2>what is it?</h2>

<p>Tracks.cute is a (partial) reimplementation of Tracks in Python and Qt.
</p>

<p>Quoting <a href="http://getontracks.org">getontracks.org</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>Tracks is a web-based application to help you implement David Allen’s Getting Things Done™ methodology. It was built using Ruby on Rails, and comes with a built-in webserver (WEBrick), so that you can run it on your own computer if you like. It can be run on any platform on which Ruby can be installed, including Mac OS X, Windows XP and Linux. Tracks is Open Source, free and licensed under the GNU GPL.

<p>I like Tracks but wanted a version that wasn't a web app. Here is a pretty picture:

<h2>how do I get it?</h2>
<p>There are no packaged releases of tracks.cute. The current source code can be retrieved using the following command.
</p>
<blockquote>git clone git://github.com/SteveG/tracks.cute.git
</blockquote>
<p>There are several dependencies. These are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Python 2.7
<li>PyQt 4.7
</ul>
<p>tracks.cute utilises the SQLite database from tracks. It should be able to open an existing tracks SQLite database file. 
</p>

<div class="singlecolumn">
<h2>how do I use it?</h2>
<p>
<b>WARNING: use of tracks.cute is at your own risk<br><br></b>
</p>
<p>Navigate to the src directory and execute tracks.py as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>./tracks.py
</blockquote>
<p>Tracks.cute will then ask you to select your database file. If you don't have an existing SQLite database file tracks.cute will create a new one using a template.
</p>
<p>Finally tracks.cute will ask you to nominate a user from within the database file.

<h2>what is it?</h2>

<p>Tracks.cute is a (partial) reimplementation of Tracks in Python and Qt.
</p>

<p>Quoting <a href="http://getontracks.org">getontracks.org</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tracks is a web-based application to help you implement David Allen’s Getting Things Done™ methodology.</p>
<p>Screenshot of context listThe main page shows all your actions sorted by context, but you can also view pages showing just the actions in one context (for when you want to focus on your office tasks, email or errands), or just the actions in one project.</p>
<p>A form on the main page lets you add actions to any context or project, whereas forms on context and project pages automatically assign the current context or project to the new next action.</p>
<p>Actions can have due dates. The ‘tickler’ allows you to schedule actions to be shown on the home page after some future date. This allows you to get the action out of your head into a concrete, safe system (where it belongs), but you don’t need to be bothered by the action until the time comes when you can actually deal with it.</p>

<p>I like Tracks but wanted a version that wasn't a web app. Here is a pretty picture:

<h2>how do I get it?</h2>
<p>There are no packaged releases of tracks.cute. The current source code can be retrieved using the following command.
</p>
<blockquote>git clone git://github.com/SteveG/tracks.cute.git
</blockquote>
<p>Tracks.cute uses: </p>
<ul>
<li>Python 2.7
<li>PyQt 4.7
</ul>
<p>tracks.cute utilises the SQLite database from tracks. It should be able to open an existing tracks SQLite database file. </p>

<div class="singlecolumn">
<h2>how do I use it?</h2>
<p>
<b>WARNING: use of tracks.cute is at your own risk<br><br></b>
</p>
<p>Navigate to the src directory and execute tracks.py as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>./tracks.py
</blockquote>
<p>Tracks.cute will then ask you to select your database file. If you don't have an existing SQLite database file tracks.cute will create a new one using a template.
</p>
<p>Finally tracks.cute will ask you to nominate a user from within the database file.
